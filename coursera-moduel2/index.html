          <p>
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to
            the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to
            mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have
            become prevalent in numerous cuisines

            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric
            times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that
            time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the
            quality or quantity of their meat
